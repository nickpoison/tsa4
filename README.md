## tsa4

- This is the new home of  [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/) but the old entry page is still there.



## astsa

- The home of [astsa - the package for the text](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa) is here too.

- See the [NEWS](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.

- A demonstration of the capabilities of `astsa` can be found here at
[**FUN WITH ASTSA**](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/fun_with_astsa/fun_with_astsa.md)


## python

- The [code in the first 3 chapters of the text has been converted to Python here.](https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master/src) 

- And a [Python package that contains datasets from `astsa` is here.](https://pypi.org/project/astsadata/)
